# Instalation

the program works on python  v3.11.7
It can work on v3.12 but there maybe problems with package installation.

install required packages
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
running ```python3 main.py``` will run the program and start and a web server will launch

any traffic sent through will be analyzed and will either be sent to a void IP (if it is a IOT Device) or just to the normal routing address.
